# A single page

Sample CSS file for a one page layout. Useful when you want to get as much
content as possible on to one horizontal page as possible for marketing or
presenting.

* This sample includes paragraphs
* As well as lists
* And visual elements like graphs
* And ofcourse an image and a code segment

```python caption="some-code.py"
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sorted = my_array.sort()
print("the sorted list of numbers:", sorted)
```

```pie-chart caption="foo vs bar vs baz"
foo,1
bar,2
baz,3
```

This example uses a simple two column layout - enough width for the piechart
legend to be readable. If you have more content you can make it three columns.

> A blockquote can make the page more interesting
